    Configure logging and start the given component.

    Assuming the root component was started successfully, the event loop will continue
    running until the process is terminated.

    Initializes the logging system first based on the value of ``logging``:
      * If the value is a dictionary, it is passed to :func:`logging.config.dictConfig`
        as argument.
      * If the value is an integer, it is passed to :func:`logging.basicConfig` as the
        logging level.
      * If the value is ``None``, logging setup is skipped entirely.

    By default, the logging system is initialized using :func:`~logging.basicConfig`
    using the ``INFO`` logging level.

    The default executor in the event loop is replaced with a new
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` where the maximum number of threads
    is set to the value of ``max_threads`` or, if omitted, the default value of
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.

    :param component_class: the root component class, an entry point name in the
        ``asphalt.components`` namespace or a ``modulename:varname`` reference
    :param config: configuration options for the root component
    :param backend: name of the AnyIO backend (e.g. ``asyncio`` or ``trio``)
    :param backend_options: options to pass to the AnyIO backend (see the
        `AnyIO documentation`_ for reference)
    :param max_threads: the maximum number of worker threads in the default thread pool
        executor (the default value depends on the event loop implementation)
    :param logging: a logging configuration dictionary, :ref:`logging level
        <python:levels>` or`None``
    :param start_timeout: seconds to wait for the root component (and its subcomponents)
        to start up before giving up (``None`` = wait forever)
    :raises SystemExit: if the root component fails to start, or an exception is raised
        when the application is running
