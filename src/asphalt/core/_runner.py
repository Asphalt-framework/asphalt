    Configure logging and start the given component.

    Assuming the root component was started successfully, the event loop will continue
    running until the process is terminated.

    Initializes the logging system first based on the value of ``logging``:
      * If the value is a dictionary, it is passed to :func:`logging.config.dictConfig`
        as argument.
      * If the value is an integer, it is passed to :func:`logging.basicConfig` as the
        logging level.
      * If the value is ``None``, logging setup is skipped entirely.

    By default, the logging system is initialized using :func:`~logging.basicConfig`
    using the ``INFO`` logging level.

    The default executor in the event loop is replaced with a new
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` where the maximum number of threads
    is set to the value of ``max_threads`` or, if omitted, the default value of
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.

    :param component: the root component (either a component instance or a configuration
        dictionary where the special ``type`` key is a component class
    :param max_threads: the maximum number of worker threads in the default thread pool
        executor (the default value depends on the event loop implementation)
    :param logging: a logging configuration dictionary, :ref:`logging level
        <python:levels>` or`None``
    :param start_timeout: seconds to wait for the root component (and its subcomponents)
        to start up before giving up (``None`` = wait forever)
