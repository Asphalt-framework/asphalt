Asphalt is a microframework for service oriented applications.

It consists of the core (this) and an ecosystem of high level components that offer additional
functionality, often by integrating third party libraries. Asphalt is unique in that it allows
developers to use both coroutine-based (asynchronous) and traditional blocking programming styles
in the same application and every API provided by any Asphalt component supports both approaches,
nearly transparently to the developer.

Asphalt is based on the standard library `asyncio`_ module and requires Python 3.4 or later.

The list of `available components`_ is on the Asphalt wiki.
